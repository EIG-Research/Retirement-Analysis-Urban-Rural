# Project: Retirement Update 2025; Urban versus Rural

# File Description: explore how firm size interacts with urban/rural.
    # larger firms have more resources, theoretically can offer retirement plans
    # with greater ease than smaller firms. Is employment in larger firms concentrated
    # in urban places?

# The median firm in an urban area has XXX employees. The median firm in a 
# rural area has YYY employees. Firmsâ€™ participation, access, matching by size.

# EJB1_EMPSIZE About how many people are employed by ... at the location where ... works?
