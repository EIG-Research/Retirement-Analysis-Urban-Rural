<h2>Data Sources</h2>

1. Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP): available for download from the Census [here](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/sipp.html)

      SIPP is a nationally representative longitudinal survey that provides information on the dynamics of income, employment, household composition, and government program participation. As the survey interviews individuals for several years over monthly surveys, it provides information about changes in household composition and economic circumstances over time.

      We rely on the 2023 SIPP survey for the majority of the analysis in this piece. Historical survey versions are used for generational cuts.

2. Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF): available for download from the Federal Reserve [here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm)

      SCF is a triennial cross-sectional survey of U.S. families. The survey data include information on familiesâ€™ balance sheets, pensions, income, and demographic characteristics.

       We rely on the 2022 SCF survey for the majority of the analysis in this piece.

3. Census 2017 Industry Codes: available for download from the Census [here](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/guidance/industry-occupation/2017-industry-code-list-with-crosswalk.xlsx)
